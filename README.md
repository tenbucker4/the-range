The Range is a shopping cart application built in ReactJS with custom CSS. Users can browse products, filter products by category, manually search for products, add items to their shopping cart, and view/edit their cart. This project allowed me to practice using everything I've learned in ReactJS so far including state, props, lifecycle methods, hooks, and routing.
